        <strong>Be the Match</strong> is a nonprofit organization that connects patients in need of bone marrow or umbilical cord transplants with donors. Their mission is to continue building a diverse and extensive registry of potential donors that contains the perfect match every person whose life depends on receiving a transplant. The advertisement that I found was made with the purpose of convincing people to join the registry.

        Both the Elaboration-Likelihood Model and <strong>Heuristic-Systematic Model</strong> attribute the processing of persuasive messages to two paths of thinking. The central route, named the <strong>systematic route</strong> in the Heuristic-Systematic Model, describes deep and deliberate thought about the message, considering the logic, strength, evidence, and principle of the argument. The peripheral route, named the <strong>heuristic route</strong> in the Heuristic-Systematic Model, describes the processing superficial cues of the message, such as the message’s length or the expertise or attractiveness of the source. Generally, in order for persuasion to occur through the central route, you must be motivated and able to process the message in depth. Be the Match generally shares its videos on platforms that reach people who believe in the goodness of humanity and are motivated by the desire to make a difference. Additionally, these videos were created to be shown in times and places where people are able to watch them without distraction, devoting their cognitive resources and time to it. Therefore, its videos employ message characteristics, including high message quality, vividness, and appeal to the culture, that are significantly more successful when processed by the central route. Specifically, the high message quality of the message is due to the fact that it appeals to core values of its audience, is clear, and provides a strong and explicit conclusion. Additionally, its message includes interesting and memorable information and stories, which strategically appeal to the beliefs and desires of its audience.

        This video recognizes the power of the identifiable victim effect, where people tend to be more moved by the story of an individual than the story of a large but abstract group of people. While the video could have shared the statistical facts of the large number of people who are waiting and depending on finding the perfect match, it instead focuses on the story of one young girl. The video introduces a young girl named Ava who passed away at 8 years old after a 3 yearlong fight against cancer while waiting to find a bone marrow match. Her story is accompanied by home videos that display her joyful, spirited, sweet personality, which creates emotional attachment and empathy. Additionally, while many people have diseases that require bone marrow transplants, sharing a child’s story appeals to the belief of preserving childhood. Furthermore, asking for people to join the bone marrow registry on behalf of Ava’s legacy lets the viewer know that even though Ava is no longer alive to benefit, her family still believes in the importance and worthiness of asking people to join the registry for the good of humanity as a whole.

        Finally, the video shares a message of hope and informs the viewers how they can be a part of this dream by joining the bone marrow registry. The way this hope is conveyed and the call to action are phrased targets aspects of Western culture. The video operates out of hope in the positive results they hope to reach, instead of fear of negative outcomes they hope to avoid. For example, tell the viewer that they can be the one to save a life. Additionally, in telling viewers “You can be the difference,” the video appeals to the independent Western culture by emphasizing on how the decision to join the registry can benefit the individual by allowing them to do something good. As people feel better about themselves when they do something they believe is good or heroic, the video presents joining the registry as an opportunity to make a difference. The video ends with very clear, straightforward instructions as to how they can help people like Ava, by giving the website for where viewers can go to join the registry.
