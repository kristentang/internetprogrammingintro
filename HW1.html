			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a fourth year Cognitive Science major and Digital Humanities minor at UCLA. Outside of the classroom, I am also involved in the <b>Bruin Ambassador Program</b> (visiting schools in the Los Angeles area and presenting information about UCLA, college, and the application process), <b>Cub Tours</b> (giving campus tours to elementary and middle school students), and <b>Bruins Fighting Pediatric Cancer</b>. In my free time, I love cooking and baking (and eating!), watching Friends, hanging out with frinends, being outdoors, and napping.

			<h2>Experimental Design: <i>Can An Experiment Prove A Mediterranean Diet Reduces Cardiovascular Risk?</i></h2>
			<p>
				The Washington Post’s “Mediterranean diet reduces cardiovascular risk” by David Brown describes the success of the “Mediterranean diet.” This diet mainly consists of vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, and olive oil. Its reduction of cardiovascular disease was measured by a reduction in occurrences of strokes. This five year study compared how people who had an above-average cardiovascular risk due to Type 2 diabetes and hypertension responded to either a control diet or a Mediterranean diet. Subjects received dietary and cooking advice based on their respectively assigned groups. Participants were mostly in their 60s. Half of the people in the Mediterranean group were given olive oil to use with their cooking as incentive, while the other half were given nuts. The control group received small, nonedible gifts weekly. Researchers studied rates of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and found a large decline in stroke rate for those who were on the Mediterranean diet.<br><br>

				A potential explanation for the success of the Mediterranean diet could be the nature of the gifts given to the participants. Subjects who received gifts related to the food they were cooking may have been more excited to cook and put more effort into making meals they perceived as high quality. This may have led them to appreciate the food, save their appetite for these meals and healthier foods, and eat slower to savor the flavors, all factors that contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, these gifts may have served as a source of inspiration for recipes and cooking, leading them to enjoy the process more and follow more closely with the dietary guidance they were given. On the other hand, nonedible gifts may not have had the same effect. This would represent the effect of a third variable, in which a confounding variable, in this case the nature of the gift, leads to an accidental perception of a relationship between two other variables, in this case type of diet and cardiovascular health. Another study that could determine the role the gift played in this experiment could have been to give subjects in the control group a food gift that was related to the recipes suggested for their diet. This would allow researchers to eliminate the third variable effect of receiving an edible gift that encouraged their diet. An additional third variable, mentioned in the article, is red wine, which is part of the Mediterranean diet and also known a preventative measure against heart attacks. A study that either included or excluded red wine from all diet groups could provide results without the potential factor of this third variable.<br><br>

				Furthermore, since subjects were only guided in what to eat but ultimately not forced to eat certain dishes, the participants’ commitment to following the guidelines for each diet may have impacted their results. It is possible that Mediterranean diet was more difficult to follow, as it involved preparing a wider variety of food, that may be considered more difficult to cook well, including many fruits, vegetables, and fish, but those that remained with the diet and stayed in the study represented a set of subjects who was more committed to doing what they believed was best for their health. This would eliminate the randomness of the groups, as those remaining in the Mediterranean diet also represented a group of people who was more committed to and conscious about their health. These people would be more likely to do other things, unrelated to the demands of the study, to improve their health, such as exercise.<br><br>

				This study was <u>experimental in design</u>, which do have the potential to have <u>causal findings</u>. However, I believe that this article’s title, which makes a broad statement, is misleading in its wide claim about the Mediterranean diet. In this study, the participants were all older adults who were already at high cardiovascular risk. This particular study does not address other members of the population, such as younger or healthier members, and its findings should not be generalized to do so as its title may suggest. This represents low external validity, when findings of an experiment cannot be generalized to the entire public.<br><br>

			<h2>Cognitive Dissonance Theory: <i>Why Is It So Stressful Deciding On A Meal At A Restaurant?</i></h2>
			<p>
				<u>Cognitive dissonance theory</u> suggests that people will expend psychological energy to restore consistency among their thoughts, sentiments, and actions. <u>Dissonance</u> is described as the state of inconsistency people feel when they experience contradictory cognitions or contradicting thoughts and behaviors, and motivates us to restore consistency. In the case of opposing thought and behavior, we change our cognition to be more consistent with our behavior, in an effort to rationalize our behavior. <br><br>

				Hard decisions are likely to cause some feelings of dissonance because it is likely that the chosen alternative has negative consequences and the rejected alternative has positive consequences. Therefore, whichever decision is made, there are some contradictory elements that remain associated with the choice, leading to dissonance. These decision generate rationalizations that make us more confortable with and confident in our decisions. <br><br>

				For example, it is sometimes difficult for me to decide what I want to order when I go to a restaurant. I often am deciding between a more expensive, but better tasting, option, and a less expensive alternative. I believe that I am someone who spends my money wisely, which can make it difficult when I want to pick the more expensive decision. Therefore, when I pick the more expensive item, instead of admitting that I am spending my money unwisely, I try to justify that decision. Often, I will rationalize my decision my telling myself I picked the healthier or more filling option, and that my body is benefiting, or by coming up with some reason as to why I deserved to splurge on that day, such as doing well on a test, surviving a long week, or working extra and having money to spend. Sometimes, I will rationalize my decision by telling myself that going to a restaurant isn’t worth it if I don’t get something that is going to satisfy me and that I can’t make on my own. <br><br>

				<u>Rationalization</u> occurring before the decision has been made is a result of us anticipating the future and trying to eliminate dissonance before it occurs. When we are leaning towards one particular choice, we are biased towards manipulating information to support our initial preference. <br><br>

				While I will defend my decision especially after I have made it and spent the money, I will sometimes begin rationalizing before I order. In this case, I usually know which dish I am leaning towards, and search for support of that choice. For example, if there are French fries in a dish that I do want, then I’ll tell myself that it’s a cheat day or that I deserve the splurge because it’s worth it to have food that tastes really good. However, if there are French fries in a dish that I’m not leaning towards, I’ll justify the other dish by telling myself I’m picking the healthier option. If the option I’m leaning towards is the more expensive one, then I’ll use even more of the information about the dish to confirm my choice. I’ll find something positive about every single ingredient in the dish. <br><br>

				<u>Effort justification</u> is the tendency to justify a decision when you devoted time, money, or effort to it and it turned out to be disappointing. If the item I picked was not satisfying, I will devote more energy to justifying my decision if it was the expensive item than if it was the cheaper option. This is because I feel the need to rationalize the extra money I spent and feel like it was a worthwhile way to use my money. This is especially true when people at my table ordered something cheaper that looks much better to me that the more expensive dish that I ordered.<br><br>
